---

## Required Permissions & Justifications

### 1. pages_show_list
**Permission Type:** Standard Access Required

**What it does:**  
Allows the app to retrieve a list of Facebook Pages that the user manages.

**Why we need it:**  
Our app is a social media management platform that enables users to:
- View all their managed Facebook Pages in one dashboard
- Select which Pages they want to connect to our platform
- Switch between multiple Pages for content management
- Display Page information (name, profile picture, follower count) in our interface

**Use case scenario:**  
When a user connects their Facebook account, we need to show them a list of all Pages they manage so they can choose which ones to integrate with our platform. Without this permission, users cannot see or select their Pages for management.

**App flow:**
1. User clicks "Connect Facebook Account" in Settings
2. User authenticates via Facebook OAuth
3. App retrieves list of managed Pages using `pages_show_list`
4. User selects which Pages to connect
5. Selected Pages appear in the app's dashboard for content management

### 2. pages_read_engagement ⭐ REQUIRED
**Permission Type:** Standard Access Required

**What it does:**  
Allows the app to read content (posts, photos, videos, events) published by the Page and engagement metrics (reactions, comments, shares).

**Why we need it:**  
Our analytics feature requires this permission to:
- Display post performance metrics (likes, comments, shares, reach)
- Show engagement trends over time
- Provide insights on best-performing content
- Track audience interaction with published posts
- Read followers data (name, PSID, profile picture)
- Access Page metadata and insights
- Generate performance reports for content strategy optimization

**Use case scenario:**  
Users need to analyze how their content performs to make data-driven decisions. Our Analytics page displays metrics like engagement rate, reach, and audience interactions for each post published through our platform.

**Detailed Facebook Justification:**  
"Our social media management platform uses pages_read_engagement to power our Analytics Dashboard where Page administrators can view and analyze their content performance. This helps them:

1. Track post performance metrics (likes, comments, shares, reach, impressions)
2. Understand audience engagement patterns to optimize posting strategy
3. View follower demographics and growth trends
4. Identify top-performing content types
5. Generate weekly/monthly performance reports

This permission adds value by providing Page admins with data-driven insights to improve their content strategy and increase audience engagement. Without this permission, users would have to manually check Facebook Insights, which defeats the purpose of our centralized management platform.

We use aggregated and anonymized data for analytics purposes and do not share individual user data with third parties. All data handling complies with Facebook Platform Policies and GDPR requirements."

- Manage content calendar with planned publications

**Use case scenario:**

### 4. pages_read_user_content

This streamlines customer service and ensures faster response times.

**Detailed Facebook Justification:**

1. **Customer Support:** Businesses can respond to customer inquiries, questions, and support requests through Messenger directly from our platform.

- Enable businesses to respond to Instagram DMs from our platform
- Provide customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities
- View and manage Instagram message threads

**Use case scenario:**

## ❌ Permissions to SKIP

### pages_utility_messaging - NOT NEEDED
**What it does:**  
Allows sending utility messages like booking confirmations, order receipts, shipping updates, and transaction notifications.

**Skip this permission unless:**
