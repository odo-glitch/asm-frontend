SELECT 
  'Your User Info' as info_type,
  u.id as user_id,
  u.email,
  CASE WHEN sa.user_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END as is_superadmin
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN super_admins sa ON sa.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.email = auth.email(); -- Your current email

-- Step 2: Check Odo Marketing organization
SELECT 
  'Odo Marketing Org' as info_type,
  id as org_id,
  name,
  slug,
  created_at

WHERE name = 'Odo Marketing';

-- Step 3: Check current organization connections
SELECT

  uo.organization_id,
  o.name as org_name,
  uo.role

-- Step 4: FIX - Reconnect you to Odo Marketing organization
