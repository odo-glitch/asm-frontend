# Organization-Based Content Library - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented organization-based content management for the content library with visibility controls and a "Create Post" button.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. Organization-Based Content Isolation
- Content is now scoped to specific organizations
- When switching organizations, only that organization's content is displayed
- Each organization maintains its own content library

### ✅ 2. Visibility Controls
Users can choose visibility when uploading content:
- **Private (Organization Only)**: Content only visible to members of the current organization
- **Shared (All Organizations)**: Content visible across all organizations the user belongs to

### ✅ 3. Create Post Button
- Added green "Create Post" button in the library header
- Opens modal to select content from library
- Multi-select functionality with visual feedback
- Shows count of selected items
- Ready for integration with post creation flow

### ✅ 4. Content Preview Support
- Images display thumbnail previews in grid view
- Videos show video icon placeholder (can be extended to video thumbnails)
- Visibility badges show on each content item (Private/Shared)
- Clean, modern UI with proper organization branding

### ✅ 5. Upload Modal with Visibility Options
- Modal opens when clicking "Upload Content"
- Radio button selection for visibility
- Clear descriptions of each visibility option
- File picker with drag-and-drop support

## Files Modified

### 1. Database Migration
**File**: `supabase/migrations/014_add_organization_to_content_library.sql`
- Added `organization_id` column to `content_library` table
- Added `visibility` column with constraint ('organization' | 'all_organizations')
- Added `organization_id` to `content_folders` table
- Updated RLS policies for organization-based access control
- Created indexes for performance optimization

### 2. Content Library API
**File**: `src/lib/content-library.ts`
- Updated `ContentItem` interface with `organization_id` and `visibility` fields
- Updated `ContentFolder` interface with `organization_id` field
- Modified `fetchContentItems()` to accept `organizationId` parameter
- Modified `fetchContentFolders()` to accept `organizationId` parameter
- Updated `uploadContent()` to include `organizationId` and `visibility` parameters
- Updated `createFolder()` to include `organizationId` parameter

### 3. Library Page UI
**File**: `src/app/library/page.tsx`
- Added state management for selected organization
- Added upload modal with visibility controls
- Added "Create Post" button and modal
- Added multi-select functionality for content items
- Added visibility badges in grid view
- Added visibility column in list view
- Integrated organization context from localStorage
- Connected file upload to visibility settings

### 4. Documentation
**Files Created**:
- `docs/APPLY_ORGANIZATION_MIGRATION.md` - Migration instructions
- `ORGANIZATION_CONTENT_LIBRARY_CHANGES.md` - This summary document

## How It Works

### Content Flow
1. **User selects organization** via BrandSwitcher in sidebar
2. **Organization ID stored** in localStorage
3. **Library page loads** content filtered by organization ID
4. **Upload content**:
   - Click "Upload Content"
   - Choose visibility (Private/Shared)
   - Select files
   - Content uploaded with organization_id and visibility
5. **Switch organizations**:
   - Content automatically filters to new organization
   - Shared content remains visible across organizations

### Database Schema
```sql
content_library
├── id (uuid)
├── user_id (uuid)
├── organization_id (uuid, nullable) ← NEW
├── type (text)
├── name (text)
├── url (text)
├── visibility (text) ← NEW ('organization' | 'all_organizations')
└── ... other fields

content_folders
├── id (uuid)
├── user_id (uuid)
├── organization_id (uuid, nullable) ← NEW
├── name (text)
└── ... other fields
```

### RLS Policies
Content is accessible when:
- User owns the content (personal content, no organization_id)
- User is member of the organization (content.organization_id matches user's organization)
- Content is marked as 'all_organizations' AND user belongs to any organization

## Next Steps / Migration Required

### 🔴 IMPORTANT: Apply Database Migration
Before the feature will work, you MUST run the database migration:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `supabase/migrations/014_add_organization_to_content_library.sql`
4. See `docs/APPLY_ORGANIZATION_MIGRATION.md` for detailed instructions

### Testing Checklist
After applying migration:

- [ ] Upload content with "This Organization Only" visibility
- [ ] Upload content with "All My Organizations" visibility
- [ ] Switch organizations and verify content filtering
- [ ] Verify visibility badges display correctly
- [ ] Test "Create Post" button and content selection
- [ ] Check that images display preview thumbnails
- [ ] Verify organization members can see organization content
- [ ] Verify content doesn't leak between organizations

## UI Screenshots (Conceptual)

### Upload Modal
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Upload Content        [X]  │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  Visibility                 │
│  ○ This Organization Only   │
│     Private to members      │
│  ○ All My Organizations     │
│     Visible across all orgs │
│                             │
│  [Choose Files to Upload]   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Content Grid with Badges
```
┌────────────────┐  ┌────────────────┐
│  [🔒 Private]  │  │  [🌐 Shared]   │
│  [Image]       │  │  [Video]       │
│  Product.png   │  │  Tutorial.mp4  │
│  2.4 MB        │  │  15.6 MB       │
└────────────────┘  └────────────────┘
```

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Indexed queries on organization_id for fast filtering
- RLS policies efficiently filter at database level
- Content loads only for selected organization

### Security
- RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- Users can only create content in organizations where they're members
- Only admins/owners can modify organization content

### Scalability
- Design supports multiple organizations per user
- Content can be shared across organizations
- Folder structure maintained per organization

## Future Enhancements

1. **Video Thumbnails**: Generate and store video thumbnails
2. **Bulk Upload**: Upload multiple files at once with progress indicator
3. **Content Search**: Search across all accessible content
4. **Folder Management**: Create custom folders per organization
5. **Content Analytics**: Track content usage in posts
6. **External Storage**: Support for AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage
7. **Content Versioning**: Track changes to content over time
8. **AI Tagging**: Automatic tag generation for uploaded content

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check migration was applied successfully
2. Verify organization_id is being passed correctly
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Supabase RLS policies are active
5. Check that user belongs to the organization
