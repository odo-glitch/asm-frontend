## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. User Fills Out Brand Profile

```tsx
// Example brand profile
{
  brand_name: "Odo Market",
  industry: "Social Media Management",
  tone_of_voice: "Professional yet friendly",
  target_audience: "Small business owners aged 25-45",
  key_values: "Innovation, Customer success, Quality",

}
```
